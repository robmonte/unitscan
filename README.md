![Alt text](http://i.imgur.com/d7TLkZm.png)

Forked from shirsig's unitscan with slight QoL improvements for usability.

The alert is visually and acoustically an exact copy of the famous addOn *_NPCScan* which first appeared during WotLK.

Commands:<br/>
**/unitscan** - Lists the active scan targets \
**/unitscan help** - Prints helpful command information in-game \
**/unitscan edit** - Opens a simple editor window to bulk add/delete targets; one name per line \
**/unitscan \<name of mob>** - Toggles on/off **\<name of mob>** to/from the scan targets \
**/unitscan volume low** - Sets the alert sound to a lower volume \
**/unitscan volume high** - Sets the alert sound back to the default volume
